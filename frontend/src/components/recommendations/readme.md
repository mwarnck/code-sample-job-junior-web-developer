## Overview

The recommendation component shows recommendations for various use cases, such as bundle options, stock levels, product measurements, lost/damaged shipments and so on. The user has the option of assigning different statuses to these recommendations. It is also possible to open the associated cta to obtain even more detailed information about the recommendation.
